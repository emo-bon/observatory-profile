# observatory-profile templates

This folder contains the water and sediment **templates** which are used in the **semantic uplifting** of the observatory, sampling and measured logsheets of an emo-bon observatory.  

The **input for semantic uplifting** are the transformed logsheets in each respective observatory repository,  
For example: [transformed logsheets of observatory-bpns-crate](https://github.com/emo-bon/observatory-bpns-crate/tree/main/logsheets/transformed).  
(Note: the semantic uplifting of the measured logsheets also makes use of [logsheet_schema_extended.csv](https://github.com/emo-bon/observatory-profile/blob/main/logsheet_schema_extended.csv).)  

The **output of the semantic uplifting** can be found in the corresponding observatory repositories, and is structured according to environment (water and sediment) and logsheet type (observatory, sampling and measured),  
For example: [sediment sampling ttl files](https://github.com/emo-bon/observatory-bpns-crate/tree/main/sediment/sampling) or [water observatory ttl file](https://github.com/emo-bon/observatory-bpns-crate/tree/main/water/observatory) of the observatory-bpns-crate.
