,source_mat_id_orig,xsd:string,xsd:string,,,NA,NA,,water;soil;arms,Sampling,mandatory,"A unique identifier assigned to a material sample according to EMO BON Handbook. This ID should be formatted as indicated in the EMO BON Handbook. This identifier will characterize the sample during nucleic acid extraction, and subsequent sequencing or biobanking and data publication. There are two columns for the material sample ID - This one, which is the value that you can enter yourself. Please try to follow the recommendation written here, but in any case make sure that this ID and that written on the sample containers are the same as each other. - The one above, which is formulated via an equation and which you cannot edit. We did this to avoid mistakes in this ID, which is THE crucial key to keep all EMO BON metadata together. To create a new value in a new row when you have a new sampling event to add to the logsheets, you can simply drag-drop from the cell above. This identifier consists of 5 terms: 1) Project (“EMOBON”) 2) Sampling Site ID; that is the Observatory ID (for example “SMN99”) supplemented with the sampling site indicator (“Wa” for water column, “So” for soft substrates and “Ha” for hard substrates) 3) Sampling Campaign Date formated as YYMMDD for Wa and So (for example, “220315” would be the campaign on 15 March 2022) and as YYMMDD_YYMMDD for Ha, i.e. including the deployment and retrieval dates 4) Size fraction (Wa: “3um” / “0.2um” / “20um” / “200um”) or organisms collected (So: “micro” for microorganisms, “meio” for meiobenthos and “macro” for macrobenthos) or ARMS fraction (Ha: “SF40” for sessile fraction sieved through 0.04mm, “MF500” for motile fraction sieved through 0.5 mm, “MF100” for motile fraction sieved through 0.1 mm) 5) Replicate number (1-4).
